### Overview

I made this so that I could quickly grade a kids' participation for the week based on a rubic my school uses. However, for some reason, the rubric didn't have a grade affiliated with it. So you'd have to make the calculation roughly off of intuition. For something as serious as a grade, intuition isn't good enough. So I decided to make a program to give it rigor.

### Dependencies
